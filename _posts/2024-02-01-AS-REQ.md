In this post, we are going to dive into a small fraction of Kerberos authentication which is AS REQ/AS REP and how we can leverage a user enumeration and eventually crack a password from it.

# Kerberos AS-REQ / AS-REP ?

An AS-REQ is part of the initial steps in the Kerberos authentication process which i'll not described in its entirety in this post. 
The authentication begins when a client (user or service) wants to access a network resource or a service. The client sends a AS-REQ to the Key Distribution Center (KDC) to request a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)

Using `kinit` we can send an AS-REQ as a user : 

```bash
kinit john.doe@DOMAIN.LOCAL
```

Simply, a AS-REQ contains (non-exhaustive) : 
* pvno :  protocol version number
* msg-type : message type (AS-REQ is type 10)
* padata : Pre-authentication data (if used)
* req-body : 
	* cname : client name
	* realm : realm name
	* sname : service name

It looks like that in `wireshark` :

From there, 3 things can happen from kerberos : 
* User doesn't exist in the Authentication Server 
* User exist (with or without pre-auth)
* User exist but the account is deactivated or blocked : `KDC_ERR_CLIENT_REVOKED`



## User does not exist

We get an error code `KRB5KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN` back from Kerberos

_User does not exist_

So what about it ? It's actually a very interesting piece of information : the AS tells us that this user does not exist. We can conduct a user enumeration.


### User Enumeration

The first step i would consider is to identify if possible what is the pattern of users either by trying to find information through osint or others protocols. If you have no idea what it could be you can try this [repo](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) which contains a lots of pattern.

Then there is just one thing to do : `kerbrute` !

```bash
kerbrute userenum --dc <ip-addr> -d domain.local userlist.txt
```

We can also use `nmap` : 

```bash
nmap -p 88 --script="krb5-enum-users" --script-args="krb5-enum-users.realm='$DOMAIN',userdb=$WORDLIST" $IP_DC
```


## Valid User

If pre-auth is enabled, the AS-REQ need to have a timestamp that is encrypted with the user's credentials. If the KDC can decrypt that timestamp using its own records, it will send back an AS-REP that contains the TGT (among others things we'll see in other posts) otherwise, we'll get an error code `KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED` back from the KDC.

_An AS-REQ with an encrypted timestamp (pre auth)_

If pre-auth is disabled, we can get an AS-REP even if we don't know the user's password. However, we can't use the TGT from the AS-REP since it's encrypted with a key we have no knowledge of.

_An AS-REP message with the TGT and the encrypted TGS session key_

But wait! we do have some interesting information which is the TGS session key that is encrypted by the user's secret key : introducing AS-REP roasting

### AS-REP Roasting

We can use `impacket-GetNPUsers` to get TGTs from users that do no have the property pre-auth set

```bash
impacket-GetNPUsers domain.local -usersfile users.txt -outputfile ASREP.hashes -dc-ip ip-addr
```

You can also use `netexec` :
```
nxc ldap ip-addr -u user.txt -p '' --asreproast ASREP.hashes
```

You can then try to crack the hashes, using either `hashcat` or `johntheripper` : 

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 ASREP.hashes wordlist.txt
```


### Valid User w/ pre-auth

We have a last thing we can explore with AS-REQ : if we are in a _man in the middle_ position we are able to capture AS-REQ pre-auth message which contains a encrypted timestamp. Capturing this message allow us to potentially crack the user's password using, again, `hashcat`.

Let say we captured traffic through wireshark. We can use [Pcredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz=) to extract the hashes :

```bash
python3 ./Pcredz -f "file-to-parse.pcap"
```

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 7500 ASREQ.hashes wordlist.txt
```


# OPSEC consideration

## User Enumeration

If an attacker sends a high volume of authentication requests in a short period, it might be detected. Failed attempts can also be logged.
Security monitoring systems may be configured to detect anomalies, such as a sudden increase in pre-authentication failures or other patterns associated with AS-REP roasting.

## AS-REP roasting

While the cracking itself happens offline, the initial AS-REP may be logged by the KDC (Event 4771). However, the initial failed request can be relatively inconspicuous. Only a repetition of failed authentications attempts can be detected or can lockout an account if policies are enforced doing so.

## AS-REQ roasting

It depends if the network traffic is analyzed. Integrity could also be checked by Kerberos. Timestamp could also be an issue.
